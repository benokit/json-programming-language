# json-programming-language

A pure, JSON-based programming language for safe transport and evaluation across system boundaries. Programs serialize as data and compile to deterministic JavaScript functions, making them ideal for HTTP communication, remote execution, and server-driven logic. This enables backends to ship executable rules, define dynamic workflows, and persist logic without exposing arbitrary code or inventing custom DSLs.

See examples in [tests](./test/test-parser.js).
